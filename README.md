# My KiCad Libraries

When designing project, I often need to add a some parts, that are not in the
official libraries and at some point in time, I found myself adding the same
part again and again. When using global libraries, they are not synced between
my devices, so here is a local library which is representation of my global
libraries.

## Additional scripts

Scripts I use with multiple projects to generate output are also added here for
my convenience.

## License

Some 3D Models are downloaded from the official websites and have a
corresponding license file accompanying them. Some Website gave the model
without a license or any additional information. So not sure about them.
Everything I designed myself is licensed under the MIT license.
